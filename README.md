# Blog
This is my blogsite, where I, as an admin, can add posts with pictures and delete my posts. People can sign up as users and then they can comment the posts. 

Hosted on [Heroku](https://node-express-mongodb-blog.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation
I was set a challenge to create a blog site using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Tech/framework used
